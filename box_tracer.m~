% Calculate tracer fluxes and concentration based on the output of box
% model
%
% The usage of this script is similar to box_rt.m. Instead of salinity, a
% tracer concentration (in this example, fraser O2) is needed to drive this
% model. O2 is not a very good tracer in the system since it is not
% conservative. In further cases other tracers should be used.
